# Backend-FirewallOVH-APIREST

This is the backend part of a REST API firewall manager.

## How to initialize the API?

1. Clone the repository or download it manually.
2. Enter the folder with a shell terminal or cmd (`cd folder`) and enter the command `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the folder.
4. Set these environment variables and fill them:
    ```
    APP_KEY=
    APP_SECRET=
    CONSUMER_KEY=
    END_POINT=
    ```
5. And that's it, start the project with the command: `node src` or `npm run dev`.
